Todo:
1. Finish creating basic gameObj class: 
  a. add types: currently {0 : empty, 1 : player}, 
     add {2 : enemy, 3: non-living} etc.
  b. implement auto-actions.
     should have a syntax similar to:
     enemy = new gameObj('enemy');
     enemy.autoAct.push(function() {
       this.move(up);
     }, 250);
     Where 250 is the delay between repatitions.
     Just add conditionals (if/else) and get awesome "AI".
     ex:
     if(enemy.isClose(player)) {
      enemy.attack(player);
     } else {
        move(up);
     }
  c. 

2. Rewrite board.js to enable usage of gameObj rendering & movement (Includes Player, Enemies, Obstacles etc);
3. Create


maybe:
1. add callback functions to board.go to ease migrating to new UI.

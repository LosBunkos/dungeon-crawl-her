1. Finish creating basic gameObj class: 
  b. implement auto-actions.
     should have a syntax similar to:
     enemy = new gameObj('enemy');
     enemy.autoAct.push(function() {
       this.move(up);
     }, 250);
     Where 250 is the delay between repatitions.
     Just add conditionals (if/else) and get awesome "AI".
     ex:
     if(enemy.isClose(player)) {
      enemy.attack(player);
     } else {
        move(up);
